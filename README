This is to test to see if I create a repository on the iPad via Working Copy, how can I get it up to the cloud. Ultimately I'll also need to see how i can get these files to be in other folders. I'm afraid that the iPad sandboxing won't allow that.

Oh was that stuff at the bottom this whole time and I didn't see it? I wonder. 

Okay, by clicking content on the main screen, then I'm able to make changes. Now I don't know how to get this to go up to github.com. How how how? 

Now I'm adding text here just to see what happens.

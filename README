This is to test to see if I create a repository on the iPad via Working Copy, how can I get it up to the cloud. Ultimately I'll also need to see how i can get these files to be in other folders. I'm afraid that the iPad sandboxing won't allow that.

Oh was that stuff at the bottom this whole time and I didn't see it? I wonder.

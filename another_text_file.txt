Ah, okay. So I figured out how to add a local repository to the github repository. 

1. You need to go to the Repository thing on the sidebar, then pick "add remote". 

2. From there go to "Create Repository" and it will walk you through connecting it to Github.com

3. I think it by default creates a private repository, but there is a selector slider that allows you to select Public as well. I went with public because nothing here is worth hiding. It's just me playing around for now.
